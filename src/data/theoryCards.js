    description: 'Explains gravity and the speed of light.',
    text: `The Theory of Relativity fundamentally changed our understanding of gravity, space-time, and the speed of light. It explains how massive objects warp space-time, affecting gravitational forces. It also introduced the concept that the speed of light is constant, leading to groundbreaking advancements in physics, such as the development of GPS technology, the study of black holes, and time dilation effects observed in fast-moving objects.`,
    moreDetails: `The Theory of Relativity is one of the most pivotal concepts in physics, revolutionizing our understanding of space and time. It demonstrates that space and time are interconnected and dynamic, rather than separate and fixed as previously believed.

The Special Theory of Relativity, introduced in 1905, states that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant and remains the same for all observers, no matter their motion. This resulted in groundbreaking revelations, such as time slowing down for objects moving near the speed of light and the contraction of length in the direction of motion. Additionally, the theory presented the equation E = mc², linking energy, mass, and the speed of light.

The General Theory of Relativity, published in 1915, provided an explanation for gravity, describing it as the warping of space-time caused by mass. According to this theory, gravity is not a force but a consequence of large objects (like stars and planets) bending space-time, guiding other objects along curved paths.

This theory not only reshaped the core principles of physics but also led to significant real-world applications, such as GPS technology, which accounts for the time dilation experienced by satellites as they move in orbit compared to Earth.`,

    text: `In 1953, the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA revealed how genetic information is stored and passed from one generation to the next.

DNA, composed of four nucleotides (A, T, C, G), carries the instructions for the building and functioning of all living organisms. This breakthrough laid the foundation for modern genetics, enabling advancements in genetic engineering, forensics, and personalized medicine`,
    moreDetails: `The discovery of DNA’s structure is one of the most significant breakthroughs in science. In 1953, the double-helix structure of DNA was revealed, explaining how genetic information is stored, replicated, and passed down through generations.

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) consists of four nucleotide bases—adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G)—which pair in a specific manner (A with T, C with G). This pairing mechanism allows DNA to replicate accurately, ensuring the transfer of genetic information. DNA encodes the instructions for building proteins, influencing everything from physical traits to susceptibility to diseases.

Since this discovery, research into DNA has revolutionized fields like medicine, genetics, forensics, and biotechnology. Advances such as genetic engineering, CRISPR gene editing, and personalized medicine have all emerged from this foundational understanding, shaping the future of science and healthcare. `,

    title: 'Quantum Mechanics',

    description: 'The world of particles and superpositions.',
    text: `Quantum mechanics, developed through the work of various physicists, unveiled a realm where particles behave in ways that challenge classical physics. It revealed that particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously (superposition) and that their behavior is governed by probabilities rather than definite outcomes. These groundbreaking discoveries led to the birth of quantum computing and have had a profound impact on technological progress, continuing to shape our understanding of the universe.`,
    moreDetails: `Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that explores the behavior of matter and energy on the smallest scales, such as atoms and elementary particles. The foundational concepts of quantum mechanics were developed by early pioneers in the field.

One key idea in quantum mechanics is the quantization of energy, meaning that energy can be transferred or absorbed in discrete quantities, or “quanta,” rather than continuously. This concept laid the groundwork for further advancements in the field. Quantum particles, such as electrons, can exist in multiple states at once—a phenomenon known as superposition. This means a particle can be in multiple places or states simultaneously until it is measured.

The Uncertainty Principle states that it is impossible to measure both the position and velocity of a particle with perfect accuracy. The more precisely one is measured, the greater the uncertainty about the other. This principle introduced a shift in our understanding of the microscopic world, where probability governs the behavior of particles, not determinism.

Another key idea is quantum entanglement, where two particles become linked in such a way that changes in one particle instantly affect the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are.

Quantum mechanics helps explain many phenomena that classical physics cannot, and it serves as the foundation for modern technologies such as lasers, transistors, and quantum computers.`,

This discovery revolutionized physics, leading to advancements in nuclear energy, X-ray technology, and cancer treatments. It also raised awareness about the dangers of radiation exposure, influencing the development of safety protocols.`,
    moreDetails: `In 1896, radiation was discovered accidentally during studies of phosphorescent materials. When observing uranium salts, it was found that they emitted energy without needing an external light source, revealing that atoms could release energy spontaneously.

Further research led to the isolation of polonium and radium, proving that radiation is a property of certain elements. This breakthrough laid the foundation for nuclear physics and medicine, contributing to the development of X-ray imaging, cancer treatments, and nuclear energy.

As the dangers of radiation exposure became clear, safety protocols and radiation shielding were developed, improving medical imaging and protecting researchers. Today, radiation remains a crucial tool in medicine, power generation, and scientific exploration.`,

    title: 'Theory of Evolution',
    image: require('../assets/img/theory/4.jpg'),
    description: 'Natural selection and species change.',
    text: `The theory of evolution by natural selection has had a profound impact on biology and our understanding of the natural world. Through the observation of species’ adaptations over time, it was proposed that those best suited to their environments are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on advantageous traits. This theory provided a scientific explanation for the diversity of life on Earth and remains central to evolutionary biology and modern genetics.`,
    moreDetails: `The theory of evolution by natural selection has had a profound impact on biology and our understanding of the natural world. By observing how species adapt over time, it was proposed that organisms better suited to their environments are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on advantageous traits. Over time, these small changes can accumulate, potentially leading to the formation of new species.

Natural selection is the central mechanism behind evolution. It posits that individuals with traits that are better suited to their environment are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass these traits onto their offspring. Over generations, these beneficial traits become more common in the population, resulting in evolutionary change.

Evidence supporting evolution is found in fossils, which show gradual changes in the anatomy of organisms, as well as in anatomical and molecular data of modern species. For example, the similarities in DNA across species confirm a shared ancestry for all living beings.

Moreover, studies of microevolution (changes within a species) and macroevolution (the development of new species) further substantiate the theory. This understanding remains foundational to fields such as biology, genetics, and ecology`,

  //     moreDetails: `Thermodynamics is the study of the relationship between heat, work, and energy in physical systems. It is governed by several key principles that describe how energy moves and transforms.

  // The First Law of Thermodynamics, also known as the law of energy conservation, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. This is why, for example, the chemical energy in fuel is transformed into mechanical energy in an engine.

  // The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that in any closed system, entropy (a measure of disorder) will tend to increase over time. This explains why processes like heat transfer always move from hot objects to cold ones, and why creating a perpetual motion machine is impossible.

  // The Third Law of Thermodynamics states that as the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, the entropy of the system approaches a minimum. This occurs because the motion of molecules slows down at extremely low temperatures.
