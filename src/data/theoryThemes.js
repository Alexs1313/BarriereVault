    label: 'How Does the Theory of Relativity Explain GPS?',
    description: `GPS satellites orbit Earth at high speeds and experience weaker gravity than we do on the surface. According to Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, time moves differently depending on gravity and velocity.  

- Special Relativity states that fast-moving satellites experience time dilation, causing their clocks to run slower.  
- General Relativity predicts that weaker gravity in space makes their clocks run faster than those on Earth.  

Combined, these effects make satellite clocks run about 38 microseconds faster per day. If not corrected, GPS would become inaccurate by kilometers in just one day. To keep location tracking precise, relativity-based adjustments are built into GPS systems. `,

    label: 'The Paradoxical Feline',
    description: `The famous thought experiment known as “The Cat Paradox” illustrates the strange nature of quantum mechanics. Imagine a cat inside a box with a mechanism that has a 50% chance of releasing poison based on a quantum event. According to quantum superposition, until observed, the cat is both alive and dead simultaneously—a paradox that highlights the bizarre behavior of particles at the quantum level.

This idea challenges our classical understanding of reality and plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics, especially in fields like quantum computing and entanglement. While it’s not a real experiment, it remains a powerful way to explain the mystery of quantum states`,

    description: `Genetics has transformed medicine by revealing how DNA affects health, disease, and treatments.  

- Genetic Testing detects inherited diseases early, such as cystic fibrosis or BRCA mutations linked to cancer.  
- Personalized Medicine tailors treatments based on a person’s genetic makeup, improving drug effectiveness and reducing side effects.  
- Gene Therapy allows doctors to correct faulty genes, offering potential cures for genetic disorders like sickle cell anemia.  

Advances in genome editing, like CRISPR, open new possibilities for treating previously incurable diseases, making genetics a key tool in modern medicine.`,

    label: 'How Did the Discovery of Radiation Change Science?',
    description: `The discovery of radiation revolutionized our understanding of atoms and energy. In 1896, it was found that uranium emitted energy on its own. Soon after, radioactive elements like polonium and radium were isolated, proving that atoms could release energy, challenging the belief that they were indivisible.

This breakthrough led to major advancements in medicine (such as X-rays and cancer treatments), physics (nuclear reactions), and energy (nuclear power plants). However, it also highlighted the dangers of radiation exposure, which prompted the development of safety protocols. Today, radiation continues to play a crucial role in healthcare, energy, and scientific research, shaping modern technology.`,

    description: `Electromagnetic waves are the foundation of modern communication. Discovered in the 19th century, these waves travel at the speed of light and vary in frequency, from radio waves to gamma rays.

Radio waves, initially used for wireless telegraphy, evolved into radio, television, and satellite communication. The 20th century saw the development of mobile networks, from 1G (analog calls) to 5G, which provides ultra-fast data speeds for the Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities, and AI-driven communication.

Each advancement in wireless technology is built on understanding electromagnetic waves, driving global connectivity and technological innovation.`,

    label: 'The Birth of Atomic Energy',
    description: `The discovery of atomic energy reshaped history, unlocking vast power sources. In 1938, nuclear fission was discovered, where splitting atoms of uranium released enormous energy. This process was later further explained and developed by scientists.

This discovery led to two major applications: nuclear power and nuclear weapons. The development of atomic bombs changed warfare, while nuclear energy was harnessed for peaceful purposes, powering cities through nuclear reactors.

While atomic energy provides clean electricity, concerns over radioactive waste and nuclear disasters remain. Today, researchers explore safer options, such as fusion energy, as a potential future power source.`,
